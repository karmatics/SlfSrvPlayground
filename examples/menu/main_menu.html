      NOTE: This is an example use of the <code><b>slfsrv-menu.js</b></code> script, which builds on
      <code><b>slfsrv</b></code> to create menus like this one to launch both web applications
      and local applications from a single integrated menu. I use this menu on my own
      Macbook because I was tired of launching some tasks from the Macintosh Dock, others
      from my browser bookmarks, and yet others from Spotlight (in fact, this menu is now the ONLY item
      on my Dock; it is also associated with a hotkey for quick access at any time).
    </p>
    <p>
      Because this is my personal menu, many of the links here likely won't work on your machine. Go
      ahead and copy this to your machine, select the &quot;edit this&quot; options, and make it your own.

      My Favorite sections is &quot;Don't look too often&quot, where I keep a lists of distracting
      web sites that I don't want to be tempted to visit too often.
